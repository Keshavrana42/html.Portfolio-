<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech) in Computer Science and Engineering (Core) at the Central University of Jammu. This program has been a great opportunity for me to build a strong foundation in computer science principles and technologies. I am passionate about learning how systems work, how software is built, and how technology can be used to solve real-world problems.</p>

<p>Presently, I am in my second year of the course, and Iâ€™ve been actively engaging with both theoretical concepts and practical applications. From subjects like Data Structures and Algorithms to Computer Networks and Database Management Systems, my academic journey so far has been both challenging and rewarding. Alongside classroom learning, I also try to stay updated with the latest trends in tech through online courses, coding platforms, and tech communities.</p>

<p>As a student, I aim to not just focus on academics but also develop skills that are relevant to the industry. I am gradually building my proficiency in programming languages like C++, Python, and Java, and I am also exploring fields like web development and machine learning. With a strong interest in innovation and problem-solving, I am looking forward to growing further as a tech enthusiast and contributing meaningfully to the field of computer science.</p>
